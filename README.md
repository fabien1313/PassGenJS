# PassGenJS

## Description

This repository hosts a random password generator program. When accessing this web page you will start a list of prompts by hitting the generate button. You will be prompted to select a password length between 8 and 128 characters. Upon selecting how long you want your random password to be you will be prompted with character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) for your personal choosing for generating a password just for you. 


## Goal

The goal of this project was to learn how to tie in all three languages effectively and showcase my ability in making a static website truly interactive. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this program is to generate a secure password. It does this by randomly selecting components of possible password criteria for you expelling personal characteristics that a user might add (which is assumable). Using the password generator will also assist in securing each account individually. If one of your accounts hosting a personal password is compromised this could leak into your other accounts should you reuse that password too many times. Make your password unique for each account and completely seperate from a mind generated password to maximize security.
